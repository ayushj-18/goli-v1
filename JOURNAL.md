# Project Idea/Inspo
I always wanted to make a combat robot when I joined robotics. This is my first attempt, and will surely not be the last.

This video inspired me to make something similar! <br>

## Day 1: June 21, 2025

### Time Spent: 2h
Researched and started some CAD. Also drew out a basic 2D view from the top & had some basic idea of the materials I would need. <br>

## Day 2: June 22, 2025

### Time Spent: 1h
Researched a bit more and did some CAD. Can't decide between Scalar horizontal weapon or the Viper horizontal weapon. I would have to research more about this.

## Day 3: June 23, 2025

### Time Spent: 4h
I would be sticking to the Scalar horizontal weapon, I made a lot of changes in CAD. But now I am facing a problem, My weapon motor is way too big, I definetly might need to get a completely different one, (the bore shaft is too big + the weapon blade looks way to close to the motor).

## Day 4: June 24, 2025

### Time Spent: 2h
I figured out the problem I was facing with my CAD, and infact I realised there was another big problem I didn't look into for really long.

After looking at the Scalar Horizontal Spinner for Inspiration, I realised what was wrong and why my project wasn't lining up like I wanted it to. My wheels are too high, resultng in my weapon motor not being able to fit in. I feel like this project is coming to an end (atleast the design part),

I really need to focus on this tomorrow for a long time and finish the design compeletly. I would also need to spend a hot hour doing the schematic and BOM so that I don't leave anything out.

## Day 5: July 2, 2025

### Time Spent: 6h
I was really demotivated these past days to work on this project, because I just felt like I couldn't make this. I scrapped so many designs and most of my research time went to waste. There was so much other stuff I was working on, and I completely forgot to work on this. Thanks so much to @Dylan and @Luke Williams on Slack for motivating me to build this and speeding up my research process. I was able to craft a BOM & make a wiring schematic.

I now have to completely redo my CAD and focus on new changes while also making my robot capable of fighting and future upgrades
