# Project Idea/Inspo
I always wanted to make a combat robot when I joined robotics. This is my first attempt, and will surely not be the last.

This video inspired me to make something similar! <br>

## Day 1: June 21, 2025

### Time Spent: 2h
Researched and started some CAD. Also drew out a basic 2D view from the top & had some basic idea of the materials I would need. <br>

## Day 2: June 22, 2025

### Time Spent: 1h+4h
Researched a bit more and did some CAD. Can't decide between Scalar horizontal weapon or the Viper horizontal weapon. I would have to research more about this. <br> 
I would be sticking to the Scalar horizontal weapon, I made a lot of changes in CAD. But now I am facing a problem, My weapon motor is way too big, I definetly might need to get a completely different one, (the bore shaft is too big + the weapon blade looks way to close to the motor).
