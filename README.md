# goli-v1
An ant weight battlebot named after my favorite mentor, Goli. Goli means "Bullet" in my native language.
This is a 1lb PLANT (Plastic Antweight) Combat Robot. The Weapon type is a Wedge, and I was inspired to make this after watching alot of combat robots. I also named it after my favourite Engineering Mentor.
